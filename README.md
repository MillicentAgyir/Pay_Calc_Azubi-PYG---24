# Pay_Calc_Azubi-PYG---24


We worked on this Hourly Pay Calculator application in Python as part of the Azubi Africa Programme. This is an application that calculates your pay based on the number of hours you have worked using your hourly rates. We finished it with a GUI to make it more user friendly.

The GUI shows these field; Your Name, Hourly Rate and the Number of Hours you have worked so far. It then uses this information to calculate your pay for the given time period.
